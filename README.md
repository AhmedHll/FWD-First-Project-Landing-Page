## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript -ES6
### What I learned

The landing page presents the first opportunity to fully combine your skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a large project.
 Aside from solidifying your skills with these three technologies, you’ll discover how best to combine them in a complex application.

The following are just some of the questions that you’ll experience along the way:

- What’s the ideal workflow?
- How many files do I need?
- Do I modify the HTML first or the CSS?
- How many JavaScript functions do I need?
- Should my function be this many lines of code?
- Is readability or performance more important?
